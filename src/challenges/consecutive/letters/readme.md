In this Kata, we will check if a string contains consecutive letters and if each letter occurs only once.

```bash
For example: 
solve("abc") = True, because it contains a,b,c
solve("abd") = False, because a, b, d are not consecutive.
solve("dabc) = True, because it contains a, b, c, d
solve("abbc") = False, because b does not occur once.
solve("v") = True

```
